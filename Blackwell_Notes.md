# Notes

- In "The Persian Women" section, give me a sentence saying that P.'s account of the bravery of the Persian women starts with King Cyrus.
- Around line 26, do something with the massively long sentence.
- In the Ochus discussion, his trick might show how powerful the memory of Cyrus was (since O. won't actually break his custom), or it might show how powerful the memory of the Persian women was.
- Also, maybe add that Alexander was outdoing the great Cyrus, showing that he is an even better king of the Persians (even though he was not Persian)
