## Plutarch
Plutarch was a Greek writer who wrote about the Ancient Greek and Roman culture. His most famous works were the *Moralia*, and *Parallel Lives*. In his *Parallel Lives* he is trying to create mutual respect between the Greek and Roman cultures by writing biographies. In the *Moralia* Plutarch is writing about various aspect of Greek culture.[^Plutarchs] One of the *Moralia* is a collection of essays called *On the Excellence of Women*. In these essays, he wrote about the heroic deeds of women. He wrote these essays for his friend Clea and discussed how these women were cable of doing the same things as men, which was against the traditional culture for him to say. [^Chauncy]

## The Persian Women

Cyrus was the son of Mandane of Media, and Cambyses I. Cyrus later became the first king of the Achaemenid Empire. He did this by leading military campaigns through Media, Lydia, and Babylon. He ended up uniting most of the middle east, which then created this empire. [!!! Fix >>> ]He is also known as Cyrus the Great and became the Cyrus told the Persians to revolt from King Astyages. Astyages was Cyrus grandfather. When Cyrus was a baby his grandfather, King Astyages, had a dream that he was going to rebel against him and try to overthrow him. Because of this, his grandfather ordered him to be killed, but instead of killing him they gave him to a shepherd. When Cyrus was ten years old, his grandfather discovered him and brought him back. When Cyrus grew older, he revolted against his grandfather just as what had happened in his dream.

Cyrus ordered the Persians to revolt against King Astyages and his army of Medes. Cyrus and his army gave up in the battle and fled back to their city.  

While the Persians were fleeing the city from the Medes, the Persian women came out, lifted their garments, and yelled at them. The Persian women were mad at them for backing down and called them all cowards. Cyrus' army was embarrassed by what these women did and said, so they decided not to give up. Astyages' army was not far behind, and the Persian army met them to continue the battle. Because of these Persian women telling them to not back down to them they ended up defeating Astyages. Astyages' army had turned against him, which had helped the Persians to be able to beat him.

Because of these Persian women being bold and not being scared to tell the army how they felt about them backing down it ended us with them creating Cyrus’s empire. The Persian women are the ones who built this empire by standing up to the army and telling them that they could not just give up like that.

Cyrus realized that these women were to thank for being able to overthrow the king, so he made it a custom that every time a king went through the city they were to give each woman a gold coin. Although most kings did this, there was one exception. King Ochus did not want to have to give each woman a gold coin every time, so he made sure that he went around the city. On the other hand, when Alexander ("the Great") conquered the Persian Empire, he would provide each woman with a child two coins every time that he would pass through the town.

By Ochus going around the city because he did not want to give the women any of his money, it showed of greedy he was as a king and would not even spare a few gold coins for the women who helped to create the empire in the first place. He also shows how mighty Cyrus was because he could still go through the city and not give them any coins but instead, he goes all the way around it, so he is not disobeying the customs that Cyrus set. Alexander showed his generosity and his compassion. This showed that he cared for the people of the town and their well being. He made sure that all of the children were taken care of.

This is the story that Plutarch told which explained how the Persian empire came to be.

## Conclusion

Plutarch wrote about the Persian women and how their bravery helped to create the Persian empire of today. He gives credit to these women for being brave and courageous by telling these men what to do. He speaks of all of these women very highly which was not normal for that time period. He honored these women and wanted to show his respect of women to his friend Clea.
